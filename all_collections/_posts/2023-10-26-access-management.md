# The Challenges of Access Management: When Clarity is Absent

Recently I was working on a task in which I was responsible for access management in Azure and applications like Azure Synapse, Machine Learning Workspace and other applications.
Even though I was having few meetings with requestors, I was not able to get clear requirements.
I managed to get this task done, but I was not happy with the result and amount of work lines of code that I had to write to get this done.
After few months of waiting for the feedback from requestor I got a feedback that I need to change the access for most of the groups that were assigned due to findings of the issues in terms of requesting access.

Access management is a crucial component of any IT infrastructure. Properly implemented, it ensures that the right individuals have the appropriate access to technology resources. However, what happens when architects and decision-makers don't have a clear vision from the outset? This post delves into some of the common challenges and ways to navigate them.

## The Effects of Unclear Requirements

Lack of clarity in initial requirements can lead to:

- **Misconfigured Permissions**: Without clear guidelines, there's a risk of granting either too much or too little access. Both scenarios can be problematic; the former poses security risks, while the latter can hamper productivity.
  
- **Increased Overhead**: Changing permissions later on requires time and effort. Each adjustment means revisiting configurations, ensuring they're correct, and potentially dealing with any issues that arise from changes.
  
- **Potential Security Risks**: Ambiguity can lead to loopholes or overlooked vulnerabilities, making systems susceptible to breaches.

## Navigating the Murky Waters

When faced with unclear directives, we should consider some strategies:

1. **Ask Probing Questions**: Sometimes, a lack of clarity comes from not having delved deep enough into the requirements. By asking the right questions, you can often tease out more detailed information.
   
2. **Document Everything**: Keep records of all discussions, decisions, and changes. This not only provides a trail to refer back to but also helps in holding stakeholders accountable.

3. **Suggest Regular Check-ins**: Instead of waiting for a final decision, propose regular meetings to discuss and clarify any uncertainties. This proactive approach can often help in gaining clearer direction faster.

4. **Seek External Advice**: If internal discussions aren't yielding clear answers, consider consulting with external experts who might provide a fresh perspective.

## Final Thoughts

Clear communication and understanding are essential in access management. While it's challenging to navigate situations where directives are ambiguous, with the right strategies and a proactive mindset, one can manage and even thrive. Remember, it's always better to seek clarity upfront than to untangle misconfigurations later on.
However in my case that didn't work at first.
